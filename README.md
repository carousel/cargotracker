# Project readme 

This is the fork of the original **Cargo tracker** application, that can be found here: https://github.com/javaee/cargotracker.    
Main intent of this project is to serve as educational resource for exploring DDD (Domain Driven Design) and modern architecture and design.  
Although Java and JavaEE are used as technical backbone, main focus will be to explore important design and architecture concepts - especially in context business modeling.  
Since most of the packages are outdated, we will improve, upgrade and polish this application, with a more modern and up-to-date implementation style and packages.  

All notable changes can be found in **CHANGELOG.md** file  

All changes and modifications of the original implementation authors personal preference <mailto:miroslav.trninic@gmail.com> and can be changed if there is better solution.  
All contributions are welcome
